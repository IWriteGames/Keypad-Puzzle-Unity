## About me

Hi! I write games and I like it! I'm Alex and welcome to my Github! I'm Gamedev and Gamedesigner and I upload my projects to Github to share them and discuss how they are programmed, which you will find later in this archive.

The reason is that I like my public repositories to be educational first and foremost. In the README you will find hints on how to improve the code!

If you like what I do, please follow me on my social networks!

## About the project

This project is a puzzle that originally appeared in the original Resident Evil.

In it, we must activate all the lights on the panel with the number buttons. The logic is simple, the light corresponding to the button and the adjacent ones horizontally and vertically will be reversed. If the light was off, it will turn on and vice versa.

The panel is a 3D modelling created by me in Blender 3.

You can find more information about the project and its architecture in the video on Youtube

## About the development and improvements

This project was originally done with HTML, CSS and Javascript for a website years ago.
When I moved it to Unity, I kept the structure of the project and the logic of the puzzle is contained in a single file called Panel.cs
The code is clean and ordered... But could it be improved?

Is it possible to optimise using arrays and is it necessary to create 9 functions for each button?
